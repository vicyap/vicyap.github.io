# Don't Code In The Dark

Not the literal dark. The figurative dark.

## Introduction

## Code Quality

This is purely a technical advantage. A individualistic view of why you shouldn't code in the dark.

At least one extra pair of eyes can make a big difference in your code quality. Mistakes are caught faster and poor
design choices are corrected sooner. This means less bugs and means you can be more productive.


## Code Legacy

This section is about being on a team and not being in the dark about your team members' code.

If you are writing a lot of code that others will have to help manage or inherit, you should stay in communication
with your peers. It's professional.

Don't lose track of your team members' code. If something goes wrong with the code and your teammate who wrote the
code isn't available (because life happens), you should be prepared.

Furthermore, if he/she is contributing poorly written code. It is just as much your responsibility as it is theirs to
revise and refactor their code. You might say "it's not my PR", but as soon as it's merged, everyone on the team will
effectively inherit that code.

"We don't want to have silos of knowledge in our teams, we want that knowledge to be spread around... You're a team, not a bunch of individuals."

## Code Professionalism (Ethics?)

This section is about the impact your code can have. Don't be in the dark about what your code can do.

[The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of | Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

Take your code seriously. Be aware of the implications of your code. Don't be in the dark about what your code can do.


## Conclusion

Code at home. Code at the park. Code at your favorite coffee shop. Code with lights on. Code with the lights off.

But don't code in the dark.
