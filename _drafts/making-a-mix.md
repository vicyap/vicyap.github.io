# Making My Avicii Tribute Mix

This blog post is about the creative workflow I went through to produce my Avicii Tribute Mix
[here](https://soundcloud.com/vicyap/avicii-tribute-mix). I'll talk about my motivation and inspirations, my approach
to understand Avicii, the 1+1=3 concept, the workflow, and finally why.

## Motivation and Inspiration

Making a tribute mix was not my idea. My sister gave me the idea the morning after Avicii died (RIP). My sister and I
have a very positive relationship. She has been working on her career in acting and it has been very inspirational to
me. She works so hard to maintain her day job as an engineer while also driving up and down Texas to all of her
auditions and shoots. Whether or not she knows it, she has inspired me to pursue my own creative outlet alongside my
day job. There are just no excuses given what I have seen from her.

So when she gave me the idea to make a tribute mix, I took it seriously. Right now, I have chosen music as my creative
outlet. To be honest, I am still shaping who I want to be as an artist, so making a tribute mix to Avicii made a lot
of sense. This mix can be a vehicle for me to represent Avicii and his amazing music while also allowing me to display
myself mixing (edit this please).

Nathan provided me motivation by pointing out my workflow on an earlier mix project. He gave me critical feedback
which I tried to use to improve my mix this time around. Caige also gave me motivation, reminding me to not let
perfection get in the way to completion.

## Avicii

How will I create a mix that stays True to Avicii? How will I create a mix that tells Avicii's Stories? My approach
was to just listen to his songs, all of his songs, back to when he came out with Ryu in 2009 all the way up through
his album release of AVICI (01). Non-stop, over and over, until I know his songs like the back of my hand.

I also listened through his [Ultra Miami 2015](https://soundcloud.com/aviciiofficial/ultra15) set a few times to build
a better picture of how he played his songs and how he performed. I asked myself a lot of questions while listening
through this mix. How did he transition songs? Does he play older songs or is it just all new stuff? Does he balance
in slower songs or is it just full blast? How does he start his set? How does he end his set?

I discovered 'Jasmine Thompson - The Days' and 'Avicii & Lenny Kravitz - Superlove' from his mix.
I also noticed that he chooses to end his set with two slower songs, including 'Avicii - What Would I Change It To'.
So how will I incorporate songs that he used in his set while also keeping it original? How will I end the set with
something meaningful the way he does with 'Avicii - Can't Catch Me'?

## 1+1=3 Concept

The 1+1=3 concept is something I made up and thought about when I first started listening to mixes. To me, some of the
best mixes are the ones that blend two or more songs together into a unique mashup that sounds better than the songs
by themselves. Thus, you get 1+1=3. What can make two songs sound better together? Sometimes the kick and bass of one
song gives the other song a new feel and energy. Sometimes the lyrics of the two songs speak about each other.
Sometimes the build of one song can add to the build of another song. Sometimes it's as if the two songs are fighting
for your attention. Sometimes it is one song teasing its entrance into the mix. Sometimes it just works and it gives
you an "Oh! Shit!" moment.

A few examples of mashups in mixes that have caught my attention.

## Workflow

### Serato to Ableton

Which songs is he best known for? Levels. I Could Be The One. Wake Me Up. Hey Brother. Broken Arrows. Without You.

Once I have a playlist for the songs I want to mix together and a rough idea of how to mix them together, I start
producing the mix with Ableton. Luckily, Ableton Standard comes with a set of audio effects under Audio Effect Rack ->
Performance & DJ which contains effects very similar to what I can do in Serato.

Reproducing the mix in Ableton presents some challenges. One is that it can be hard to remember exactly how I had
planned to transition two songs. When playing around on Serato, I improvise a lot, so remembering and reproducing
that feeling is harder in Ableton. I got around this by simply having the controller and Serato open while working in
Ableton. So at any time, if I forgot how I was going to transition two songs, I can just replay it on the controller
until it sparks my memory.

Another challenge which I did not expect was listening fatigue. While playing with Serato, I only get one shot at
mixing two songs. Once I start the mix, I have to commit to it and figure out how to keep it smooth and steady. But in
Ableton, I can replay a transition over and over. And I might have to in order to make sure it sounds smooth and
steady throughout. (In Serato I can do constant live adjustments to the mix to smooth it out.) I realized after many
replays of the same transition, I started to lose a sense of if the transition sounds good or if I am just tired of
listening to it.

### Demo the First Draft

I released a first draft a few people so I could get feedback. Nathan Elling. My sister. A few others. Since I was
pushing to have this done in a week, I only gave the first draft demo a day for feedback. I got compliments from my
sister and good feedback from Nathan Elling. However I would say that most of the changes I made were from my own
feedback. After sleeping and clearing my mind. I relistened to my mix and noted everything I did not agree with. I
wrote down what I did not agree with as I listened through, twice. It's important that I don't pause the mix since I
was also trying to get a feel for the overall energy and journey. Is the mix exhausting? Is it boring at spots? Is it
distracted? Is it disruptive to listen to?

Regardless of what anyone says, I get to choose what needs to be changed and what does not. This is my own creativity
and if something is a subjective, creative matter, I need to take responsibility for it.

### Listen in a Variety of Settings

* Headphones
* Car with subwoofers
* While running
* While working
* While listening intently

## Why

Why did I bother making this mix? Practice. I'm really just building, training, crafting a skill that makes me happy.
Music is an outlet for me to express myself; it reminds me to feel joy, heartbreak, rage, excitement, surprise, etc.
I've also seen music as a way for us to communicate in a way different from words. Music can push us to reveal
ourselves to each other, to express raw feelings and emotions, and that makes me happy. So making this mix is just a
small step in a personal journey to cultivate my craft so that others can enjoy what I will create.

## Thanks

If you've read this far, thanks for taking your time to read this. I hope you'll enjoy this mix. :)


## Outtakes

### Finding a good mashup

But, finding a good mashup does not mean you just start playing every pair of songs together until you get that magic
mix. Some quick math will tell you that with just 10 songs, that would be 45 possible pairings, and with 100 songs
that would be 4950 pairings. That's only 100 songs but that's way too many pairings to try. And this doesn't even
count the many spots you can choose to mashup a pair of songs. So I've come up with a few guidelines for deciding if
two songs will mix well together.

* Avoid putting vocals on vocals, unless you can hear each clearly. Otherwise it might just sound like crowded chatter.
* Check that the BPMs are close. Stretching one song's bpm to fit another can sound unnatural and/or may introduce
artifacts.
* Check that the melodic keys mix. Two songs with clashing melodic keys can create dissonance.

Of course these are just guidelines and with enough creativity, you can do whatever you want to mashup two songs if you
really believe they belong together.
