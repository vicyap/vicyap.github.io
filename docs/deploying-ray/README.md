What is [Ray](https://www.ray.io)?

From their website, "Ray is an open source project that makes it simple to scale any compute-intensive Python workload â€” from deep learning to production model serving".

## Backstory

(save this for the blog post)

Our previous distributed batch processing tool was AWS ParallelCluster with SGE.

## Technologies

In this walkthrough, I will deploy Ray using Terraform + EKS + Karpenter.
