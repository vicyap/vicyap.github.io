This blog post is about the creative workflow I produced my Avicii Tribute Mix
[here](https://soundcloud.com/vicyap/avicii-tribute-mix). I will talk about the inception, my approach to understand
Avicii, the 1+1=3 concept, my workflow,
and why.

## Inception

My sister gave me the idea to make an Avicii tribute mix. It was the morning after Avicii died.

My sister is six years older than me. After college, she started her career as a mechanical engineer. This was good,
stable, and kept my parents happy. However a couple of years ago, she started taking acting classes. She found a
creative outlet. She found her creative outlet.

Now, she is engaged in both her engineering career and acting career. Sometimes struggling to balance both. There are
times that I believe she is overwhelming herself. Perhaps she feels the same way. But of everyone I know, my sister has
demonstrated how to push the limits of her abilities and fortitude.

My sister is a role model to me. A diligent, creative, and strong individual. So, when she gave me the idea to make an
Avicii tribute mix, I felt compelled to take it seriously.

## The 1+1=3 Concept

Why would anyone choose to listen to a mix instead of a playlist? What, if anything, makes a mix any better than a
playlist? I'm sure different people have different answers. I enjoy mixes because you can listen to more songs in less
time. But, the better reason for why I listen to mixes is for the mashups. A mashup can put a song in a different
context, in a different spotlight, in a different energy. To me, that's very interesting and exciting. A good mashup
can sound better than the two songs individually.

When two songs mashed up sound better than the songs individually, I think 1+1=3. The 1+1=3 concept is something I
thought about since I started listening to mixes. I think some of the best mashups really catch the listener off guard.
It makes the listener say "What is that?" Or
[Damn Son! Where'd you find this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_x_4UElTDI) A few examples of mashups in mixes
that have caught my attention:

* [Mix Series Vol. 1: Beginnings by HAYDEN JAMES](https://soundcloud.com/haydenjamesartist/mix-series-vol-1-beginnings) @ 37:38, Tchami - Adieu v. Odesza - Say My Name (Hayden James Remix)
* [HSMF17 Official Mixtape Series #1: CRAY by HARD hardfest.com](https://soundcloud.com/hardfest/hsmf17_cray) @ 13:15, Medasin & X&G - The Zoo (ft. Josh Pan) v. Valentino Khan - Deep Down Low
* [NEST HQ Guest Mix: What So Not (Live From Stereosonic Sydney 2013) by NEST HQ](https://soundcloud.com/nesthq/nest-hq-guest-mix-what-so-not) @ 16:35, Major Lazer - Get Free (What So Not Remix) v. Flume - Holding On

## Workflow

There were four phases to making the mix: understanding the songs, experimenting with Serato, perfecting with Ableton,
revise until satisfied.

Alright so I'll finally explain about my workflow. I first start off in Serato, then translate my ideas into Ableton.
After I have a rough draft, I send that out to a select few people who I think can provide me critical feedback. I'll
also listen through the rough draft and take notes on what I want to change. After I consider the feedback and my own
notes, I update the draft and repeat the drafting process until I am happy with it.

### Understanding The Songs

You can't mix songs if you don't know them. It's as simple as that. I put together a Spotify playlist of all of the
Avicii songs I could find, including remixes. I listened to that playlist constantly, learning the intros, the builds,
the drops, the outros, the bridges of the songs.

In addition to listening to his songs, I also listened to his
[Ultra Miami 2015](https://soundcloud.com/aviciiofficial/ultra15) set. How does Avicii direct his mix? How does he
transition one song to another? Does he give time to slower songs or is the energy always up and up? Listening
to this set helped me formulate a better picture of Avicii as a performer, as an artist.

### Experimenting with Serato

Now the fun part. 1+1=3 remember?

How does this vocal sound with that song's bassline? Can I build this song into that drop? How can I bring in the next
song with enough subtlety to make the listener think "What is that?" Can I loop an outro as I bring in a new song? How
can I emphasize this song? How can I edit this song to be shorter? What gives me chills? What makes me feel joy? How
can I transition to a slower song? How can I speed up the tempo?

Experimentation. Curiousity. Feeling.

### Perfecting with Ableton

Now it's time to be picky.

After experimenting with Serato, I will have a specific order of songs I want to transition through. Now I have to
translate the improvised mix of songs from Serato to Ableton. However, with Ableton, every tempo change can be
executed perfectly and every knob can be turned precisely.

But there was an unexpected challenge with Ableton, listening fatigue. I would catch myself listening to the same
transition over and over, trying to reproduce the same feeling and balance that I had achieved in Serato. But after
ten listens, it starts to sound the same. After twenty listen, I start to get impatient and just want to move on. To
combat listening fatigue, I would jump around when adjusting specific transitions. It might sound counterintuitive,
but this allowed me to keep fresh ears.

### Revise Until Satisfied

It won't be perfect. It can never be perfect. There will always be something to tweak and tinker.

So when is it good enough? It is when I am satisfied (more generally until you, the artist, is satisfied).

After making a first draft in Ableton, I will listen through a couple of times and make notes on things I want to
change. I also share the draft  with a few friends who I believe can give me good feedback. Good feedback is conscious
and critical. Good feedback is being told what sounded appealing and what sounded appalling. Good feedback is honest.
Good feedback is detailed.

However, no matter how much good feedback I got, it is important to remember that I don't revise anything that makes
me uncomfortable. Ultimately, it is my creation, and I have to stay true to what I want to create and don't let too
many opinions sway and confuse me.

So, I iterate. I keep listening to the songs, seeking overlooked gems. I keep experimenting in Serato, discovering
new mashups and transitions. I keep perfecting in Ableton. I keep revising until I am satisfied.

## Why

Why did I bother making this mix? Practice.

I have deemed my creative outlet to be music. Music reminds me to feel joy, rage, sorrow, excitement, surprise, and
many more emotions. Music helps me understand myself by revealing what I feel. In this way, music encourages us,
collectively, to reveal ourselves to each other. And the world can be a better place with a little more honesty and
openness.

## Afterthoughts

Anyways, if you've read this far, thank you. I hope you've enjoyed reading this and I hope you will enjoy this mix.
