# Making My Avicii Tribute Mix

This blog post is about the creative workflow I went through to produce my Avicii Tribute Mix
[here](https://soundcloud.com/vicyap/avicii-tribute-mix). I'll talk about my motivation and inspirations, my approach
to understand Avicii, the 1+1=3 mashup concept, the workflow, and why.

## Motivation and Inspiration

Making a tribute mix was not my idea. My sister gave me the idea the morning after Avicii died (RIP). My sister has
been my role model in the creative arts. Hey day job is working as a mechanical engineer, But  she has  also been
making moves towards an acting career. She works very hard to maintain her day job as an engineer while also putting
extra effort and time into her acting lessons, auditions and shoots. She has really inspired me to pursue my own
creative outlet. Compared to her, there are not excuses. So when she messaged me about making an Avicii tribute mix, I
took it seriously.

Another motivation was the positive feedback I got from a mix I made two weeks beforehand. This mix was just me mashing
up the songs I've really enjoyed so far this year. And when I showed it to some of my friends, I got a lot of positive
reviews and some critical feedback. I think the biggest compliment I got was "sounds pro". This was a big deal to me
because I've been considering myself as an amateur DJ and wannabe producer. But after hearing that, I realized I need
to take myself more seriously, more professionally, if I really want to transform this passion into something.

## Understanding Avicii

Trying to understand Avicii was quite a challenge, especially from just listening to his music. I decided against
doing research into Avicii's life itself for a few reasons. First, it would take too long since my goal was to release
the mix within a week's time. Second, I didn't have a personal connection to Avicii, so I did not feel justified to
even attempt to make a tribute mix about his life itself. Third, it's his music that people will remember, so I should
focus my energy on understanding him as a producer and performer.

Naturally I started to ask a boatload of questions. How will I create a mix that stays True to Avicii? How can I
craft a mix that tells Avicii's Stories? How does he play his own songs in performance? Which songs does he choose to
play in a performance? Does he balance in old songs with new songs? Does he quickly switch from song to song? Which
songs is Avicii known best for? How can I emphasize those songs that he's best known for?

I listened to his music, as much as I could find on Spotify at least. Non-stop listening. Every opportunity I got to
listen to music, it would be Avicii. I began to  slowly get a better picture of his songs. Gradually  getting an
intuitive sense of this songs. You can't mix songs together if you don't even know their song structure. And the real
creativity comes when you can mashup specific elements of a song with another songs. I also listened to his 
[Ultra Miami 2015](https://soundcloud.com/aviciiofficial/ultra15) set. This helped me build a picture of Avicii as a
performer. I discovered 'Jasmine Thompson - The Days' and 'Avicii & Lenny Kravitz - Superlove' this way. I also
noticed that he ended his set with slower songs that contained more meaningful lyrics. Songs such as
'Avicii - What Would I Change It To' and 'Avicii - Can't Catch Me'. I'll have to find a way to emphasize these songs.

I decided to end the mix with 'Jasmine Thompson - The Days', a cover of Avicii's The Days. Then followed with
'Avicii - Somewhere in Stockholm'. Something about those lyrics are  eerily relevent to his death. In any case, it ends
on a celebratory, uplifting note.

## 1+1=3 Mashup Concept

Why would anyone choose to listen to a mix instead of a playlist anyways? What, if anything, makes a mix any better
than a playlist of songs? I'm sure different people have different answers. For me, I enjoy mixes because you can
listen to more songs in less time. But, the better reason for why I listen to mixes is for the mashups. A mashup can
put a song in a different context, in a different spotlight, in a different energy. To me, that's very interesting
and exciting. A good mashup can sound better than the two songs individually.

When two songs mashed up sound better than the songs individually, I think 1+1=3. The 1+1=3 concept is something I
coined and thought about since I started listening to mixes. What makes two songs sound better together anyways?
Sometimes the kick and/or bassline of one song can give another song a different feel and energy. Sometimes the lyrics
of two songs speak to each other. Sometimes the build of one song can add more excitement to the drop of another song.
Sometimes it's as if there are two songs fighting for your attention. Sometimes it's teasing one song before the mix
actually plays it. Sometimes it just works and you get an "Oh! Shit!" moment. The number of ways you can mashup two or
even more than two songs is only limited by your imagination.

I think some of the best mashups really catch the listener off guard. It makes the listener say "What is that?" Or
[Damn Son! Where'd you find this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_x_4UElTDI) A few examples of mashups in mixes
that have caught my attention:

* [Mix Series Vol. 1: Beginnings by HAYDEN JAMES](https://soundcloud.com/haydenjamesartist/mix-series-vol-1-beginnings) @ 37:38, Tchami - Adieu v. Odesza - Say My Name (Hayden James Remix)
* [HSMF17 Official Mixtape Series #1: CRAY by HARD hardfest.com](https://soundcloud.com/hardfest/hsmf17_cray) @ 13:15, Medasin & X&G - The Zoo (ft. Josh Pan) v. Valentino Khan - Deep Down Low
* [NEST HQ Guest Mix: What So Not (Live From Stereosonic Sydney 2013) by NEST HQ](https://soundcloud.com/nesthq/nest-hq-guest-mix-what-so-not) @ 16:35, Major Lazer - Get Free (What So Not Remix) v. Flume - Holding On

## Workflow

Alright so I'll finally explain about my workflow. I first start off in Serato, then translate my ideas into Ableton.
After I have a rough draft, I send that out to a select few people who I think can provide me critical feedback. I'll
also listen through the rough draft and take notes on what I want to change. After I consider the feedback and my own
notes, I update the draft and repeat the drafting process until I am happy with it.

### Serato

I start off with Serato and my little Denon MC4000 DJ Controller. That's my only DJ controller right now, so I'll just
have to make it work. I analyze all of the songs, Serato figures out the key and bpm of each song, and then I start
mashing up the songs in a live way. I do my best to improvise the mashups back to back to back. After about an hour or
so, I look back at the order of songs I went through and try to repeat what I did. Sometimes I come up with something
better. Sometimes I realize something doesn't quite fit. Eventually I arrive to playlist I can feel confident about.

### Ableton

Now it's time to perfect the mix. In Ableton, I can automate everything I was doing "live". I just have to remember
what I was doing live and reproduce it with what comes with Ableton. (I used Ableton Standard for this mix, in case
you were curious). Fortunately, Ableton has a section in their Audio Effects for "Performance & DJ". In this mix, I
only used effects from that section.

Reproducing in Ableton had a couple of challenges. One is that it can be hard to relive what I was doing with Serato.
How exactly did I plan to transition from 'Avicii - So Excited' to 'Avicii - City Lights'? This transition gave me the
most trouble in Ableton. In Serato I can adjust EQs, gains, filters all on the fly to really blend the two songs. But
when I was dealing with this transition in Ableton, it never quite sounded the same as I had played it in Serato. My
way around this problem was to just have Serato and my controller ready right next to me. Now I could just replay it
and reverse engineer my own thought process.

Another challenge that was more subtle was dealing with listening fatigue. While in Serato, I only get that one chance
to make a transition or mashup work. If I don't like how I did it, too bad, it's on to the next song and another
chance at a new transition. However in Ableton, I have to listen to the same transition over and over, with minor
tweaks, in order to get it just right. After so many replays, I just want to move on. I worked around this by working
on the mix in separate sessions. It takes more time, but it is well worth it, because at least for me, my brain just
did not want to relisten to the same transition again.

### First Draft

After I have a full mix, I'll send it out to a select few who I believe can give me critical feedback. We'll call them
the "first drafters". This includes friends know music production, friends who listen to mixes regularly, and just
general listeners. It's important to include not just music producers but also the general audience. It's easy to get
overly picky about how things should sound that you forget that it doesn't really matter to the general listener.

After the first draft, I will also force myself to take a break and later relisten to the mix. This is probably where
most of the revisions come from. I do consider the feedback that the "first drafters" provide, but "[I] gotta stay
true to what [I] want to create and don't let too many opinions way [me] and confuse [me]", as my sister as once told
me. I tried to listen my first draft in a variety of ways, such as with headphones, in my car, laptop speakers. And as
I listen, I take notes without interrupting the playback. In this way I try to listen to the mix as if I was anyone
else. I need to make sure it sounds good in all settings.

For each note, I might make an edit. If I make an edit, I write what I did to revise what I changed. If I do not make
an edit, I write why I chose not to. This helps me keep track of how I fixed things I might come across again, and it
helps me stay objective when making edits. It's important to stay objective, because if I was making edits
subjectively, I might decide to revert my edit tomorrow simply because I feel like it.

### Until I'm Happy

I continue this drafting process, as many times as I need to, until I am confident, satisfied, and happy with what
I've made. I believe this is about being professional and high quality, not about being perfect. I know there will
always be that one thing that I still want to change. Even now, the transition from 'Avicii - So Excited' to
'Avicii - City Lights' still bothers me. But as long as I am at a point where I feel confident sharing the mix, I will
not have to fill embarrased by it. To me, pursuing professionalism and high quality is fine, but sometimes pursuing
perfection can get in the way of completion.

## Why

Why did I bother making this mix? Practice. I'm really just building, training, crafting a skill that makes me happy.
Music is an outlet for me to express myself; it reminds me to feel joy, heartbreak, rage, excitement, surprise, etc.
I've also seen music as a way for us to communicate in a way different from words. Music can push us to reveal
ourselves to each other, to express raw feelings and emotions, and that makes me happy. Seeing others experience
themself and others in a unrestrained, unburdened way, makes me happy. So, to me, making this mix is just small step
in a personal journey to cultivate a craft that others can enjoy.  

## Afterthoughts

If you've read this far, thank you for taking your time to read this. I hope you've enjoyed reading this and I hope
you enjoy the mix even more.
